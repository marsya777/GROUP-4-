Introduction of the System

Student attendance is one of the crucial parts in academic institutions. Lecturers and academic administrators rely on attendance records to monitor student participation, evaluate learning engagement, and ensure compliance with institutional requirements for coursework and examinations (Rashid, 2024). Attendance generally shows a reflection on a student's behavior, responsibility and commitment to their studies.
Most universities are still depending on traditional manual attendance registration methods such as paper and sheets or name call, even though attendance is often seen as the most important part. Manual attendance records are vulnerable to human error, loss of documents, and inaccurate record-keeping. There is also limited control over dishonest practices, such as proxy attendance, where students record attendance for absent peers (Sidek et al., 2016).
As student enrollment continues to grow and academic schedules become more structured, manual attendance management has proven to be increasingly inefficient. Previous research indicates that automated attendance systems can significantly improve record accuracy, reduce lecturers’ administrative burden, and enable attendance data to be stored, retrieved, and managed more systematically (Rashid, 2024; Bakhri et al., 2025). Recent advancements in biometric technologies, particularly facial recognition, have attracted attention as a potential solution to further streamline the attendance process while minimizing the need for manual verification (Haris & Paidi, 2023).
	Going against these obstacles, this project offers the solution, a modern attendance management system that simplifies and modernises the registration, storing and managing student attendance records. It hopes to help lecturers in managing attendance smoothly within the academic environment.

Project Background

In the past, attendance tracking mainly relied on manual registrations, handwritten signing sheets and name calls during class sessions are the main examples. While these approaches were once enough, they often resulted in inefficiencies such as disrupted limited class time and the teaching flow, misrecorded attendances, and difficulties in storing or retrieving records for reference in the future. These methods are easily damaged, misplaced or even manipulated which raises concerns about its integrity and accountability. Additionally, compiling attendance reports manually is time consuming and prone to inconsistency especially for large classes.
	
	The IT field is moving fast and this has helped schools and other educational places get better and more reliable tools. They are using things like websites, computer systems and phones to do jobs. Now they have ways to check people's identities like using special scans QR codes and ID cards, which are better and safer, than the old paper ways. The IT field has made all these new methods possible so schools can use IT to make things easier and more secure. By delivering a central online system to digitally log attendance data in real-time, securely store it, and effortlessly retrieve it by accredited individuals, this attendance system leverages these tech innovations. By swapping conventional methods with computerized processes, schools can boost clarity, lessen managerial issues, and uphold consistent execution of attendance protocols.


Purpose of the System

The main purpose of this university attendance system is to provide a practical and automated solution that makes the process of monitoring student attendance while improving data accuracy simpler and more reliable. By reducing reliance on manual input, the system minimizes human error and crucially shortens the time needed to record the attendance during classes. It also helps to prevent attendance fraud by implementing controlled and verifiable attendance systems.

	The system is designed to support student’s responsibility and academic awareness. Students can view their attendance records allowing them to always aware and checks on their participation in the class and to make any changes if their attendance drop below the needed attendance percentages.

	The system provides structured reports and analysis that are used to identify and monitor class performances, and detect early warning signs of student’s disengagement for the lecturers. Lastly, overall academic management can be upgraded by providing accurate data and improving its accountability.
