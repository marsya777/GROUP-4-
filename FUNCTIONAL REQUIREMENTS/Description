We have divided five main functional requirements specifically for our Online University Attendance System that each of them will be transform into flowcharts and pseudocodes.
In the aspect of User Authentication and Role Management, the system checks for the presence of a person trying to log in. Therefore, all users either students, lecturers or administrators will need to identify themselves in the system in order to ensure that intruders cannot log in. For example, students will need their login name and password in order to log in to the official website of the university.
The overall idea of Role Management is to point out the permissions that have been allotted to each type of user on the platform. For example, the student can view their own attendance records, the teacher can take attendance and view details related to classes, whereas the administrator can handle courses, users, and settings of the platform.
Both User Authentication and Role Management must functions well to guarantee limited access for selected users, which will safeguard critical information and prevent damage to the attendance system.

Next the Course and Class Management system helps manage all the things that have to do with courses or classes. The people in charge like lecturers or administrators can make new courses, change courses or get rid of courses. They can also keep track of which student in each course, what the schedule is for the classes and how much time is set aside for the classes. The system knows which students are taking which courses and classes. The Course and Class Management system is really important, for keeping everything organized. It also guarantees the correct presentation of the academic timetable for the university on the platform, ensures that students are placed in the correct classes, and facilitates attendance monitoring.

Next, the Attendance Recording. This means the platform can keep track of student attendance for every class. For instance, lecturers can choose to mark attendance by hand or use ways like QR codes, digital check-ins or seeing who takes part in online classes. Every time attendance is recorded by a student, the system will automatically track the student's course on that time, which helps keep everything accurate. Not only that, the system also provides for control of late coming or absence with appropriate indication of status. This functionality ensures that the attendance information is accurate, reliable, and available for reporting and review which has great significance for academic monitoring and compliance with the university's regulations.

Attendance Viewing and Tracking will let instructors and administrators view a student's attendance history for analyzing missed class patterns and catching red flags that identify students who could be direly affected by missing classes. The views in the system are organized and can be filtered to analyze the attendance patterns by student, course, or date. We can facilitate academic integrity in staff and students through openness, accountability, and rapid monitoring.

The Attendance Reporting will help the system gathered all the attendance information. It will show us the attendance in a way that's easy to understand, which is reports in terms of every day, every week or for the semester. Not only that, it can also make custom reports based on the students the classrooms they are in and the courses they are taking. The attendance report then save these reports as an Excel file or a PDF file if we need to use them for management purposes. We can just look at them online anytime. Hence, this can be useful for teachers and authorities to observe patterns of attendance, detect abnormalities and make related deductions concerning performance in students or teaching techniques.
