PROJECT NAME : ONLINE UNIVERSITY ATTENDANCE SYSTEM

DESCRIPTION : 

A web-based digital platform intended to monitor, schedule, and record how frequently students attend classes in a full-fledged university which allow lecturers and administrators to check student's attendance history, enter attendance digitally, and manage the courses, classes, and user accounts.

This project is about resolving the problems that traditional attendance-tracking methods, such as paper and digital sheets are very tiring, error-prone, and difficult to maintain with. The platform provides advanced educational supervision and data presentation while improving correctness, productivity, and transparency with the automated attendance tracking.

It is designed for operation among university students, administrators and lecturers. The administrators used to oversee scholastic frameworks and generate institution reports, while the lecturers are using these systems to record and evaluate the attendance data. Meanwhile, students use this system to update their attendance everyday.
