PROJECT DESCRIPTION : 

# Student Attendance Management Platform

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a web-based digital platform designed to monitor, plan, and record student attendance in a university environment.  
It enables teachers and administrators to track attendance history, manage courses and classes, and handle user accounts efficiently.

The platform aims to replace traditional attendance methods (paper-based or manual digital records) that are time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to manage. By automating attendance tracking, the system improves accuracy, productivity, and transparency.
